*Given that it is my job to audit the ECU's firmware, I believe that is my duty to report all security problems no matter the complexity. The only person I should really be telling is my boss, that's if he does his job and takes the required action to fix the security issue. Failing that, I would go higher and report my findings and what was done (if anything was done) in response to my findings. I would keep making noise about the situation until it is fixed. I think that because I am an employee of the company it is my duty to exhaust all options with those inside the company before I turn to outside sources. Going about it that way proves my loyalty to my company as well as making it clear I’m unwilling to sacrifice my integrity. For if I am without integrity, who am I really loyal to? In the event that my company is unwilling to postpone the ECU’s release, I will go to the proper authorities and report my findings to them. If it does get to this stage I would resign from my post at the company. I want nothing do to with a company that endangers the lives of its consumers. If going to the authorities doesn’t bring the desired change, I would be forced to go public. I believe that not doing anything would be the same as condoning the actions of the company and thus I would be responsible for the harm that results. I knew of the danger and though I didn’t have the power to change it myself, I had access to those who could.  Whether I like it or not, I’m involved. Collecting the data was my job, but it is my moral duty to do everything in my power to make sure the dangers are known and dealt with. Failure to do so makes me guilty.*
